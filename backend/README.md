# 🕹️ Stickman Game

A full-stack **Stickman Adventure Game** built with **Flask (Python)** for the backend and **Vite + React** for the frontend.

The game allows players to sign up, log in, select seasons and levels, and play through fun and challenging stages — all while their progress is saved and tracked. This project demonstrates integration between a modern JavaScript frontend and a Python Flask backend API.

## 🧠 About the Project

**Stickman Game** is an interactive, level-based adventure game inspired by classic side-scrolling action games.  
The goal is to navigate the Stickman character through multiple levels while avoiding obstacles, earning points, and progressing through increasingly difficult challenges.

The system is divided into two main parts:
- 🎨 **Frontend (Vite + React)** – Handles the game’s visuals, user interface, and level interactions.
- ⚙️ **Backend (Flask + SQLAlchemy)** – Manages authentication, data storage, and level progress tracking.
